\section{Python scripts}

\subsection{3dNicaragua.py}

\subsubsection{Purpose}

Used to generate a 3D topographic plot of the area around Masaya from DEM data.

\subsubsection{Usage}
The script should be run from a UNIX command line as follows:\\\\
\tab \texttt{\$ python3 <py-path>/3dNicaragua.py <demFile>}\\\\
where:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{<py-path>} is the path (either relative to the current directory, or full) to the directory in which the python script is located (replace with “./” if it is in the current directory).
\item \texttt{<demFile>} is the path (relative or full) to the DEM data file. This should be a tab delimited ASCII file with the 6 lines of metadata (ncols, nrows, xllcorner, yllcorner, cellsize, NODATA\_value) followed by a matrix of topographic heights (m) where the top-left/bottom-right heights correspond to the North-West/South-East corners of the area covered by the DEM data.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Dependencies}
The script requires a number of external python packages to be imported. CEMAC periodically asks faculty (FoE) IT suppurt at the University of Leeds to add any required packaes to the loadable python/python-libs modules. Any faculty member should therefore be able to access the required packages by typing the following into the UNIX command line:\\\\
\tab \texttt{\$ module load python3}\\
\tab \texttt{\$ module load python-libs}\\\\
If the user still experiences any import errors when running the script, they should install the missing python packages themselves.

\subsubsection{Output}
Running the script successfully will launch the 3D plot in a separate window. The left and right mouse buttons can be used to rotate and zoom in/out of the plot, respectively.

\subsubsection{Algorithm details}
The python script works as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item The DEM metadata is read in, and the lower left x and y coordinates, along with the cell size, is used to calculate the projected coordinates of each data point. These are then converted to lat/lon using the utm package, assuming a UTM zone P16 projected coordinate system (appropriate for the Masaya area of Nicaragua).
\item The DEM height data are also read in, and any `NODATA' values (measurements taken over water) are replaced with zeros.
\item The Basemap and matplotlib packages are used to plot the 3D data.
\item The `stride' parameter is hard-coded to 100 but can be reduced to increase the resolution of the plot (takes longer to execute).
\end{itemize}

\section{CALPUFF: Installation guide} \label{Installation}

\subsection{General compiler settings}
***The intel compilers are preferred***\\\\
To use the pgi compilers:
\begin{itemize}
\item Switch out the gnu compilers for the pgi compilers using: \texttt{\$ module switch gnu/native pgi/16.9}
\item Compile using: \texttt{\$ pgf90 -O0 -Kieee -Ktrap=fp -Msave <mainFortranFile>.f -o <mainFortranFile>\_pgi.exe}. These compiler flags are based on the ones given here: \url{http://www.src.com/calpuff/FAQ-answers.htm#1.1.13}. Note that the -tp flag has been removed, as the default is to build as appropriate for the current system, and the pgi library path has also been removed, since this is added to LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH by default when loading the pgi module (can confirm using `\texttt{\$ module show pgi}'. The remaining flags do the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{\textbf{-O0}} -- Don't perform any optimisation (compilation will be fast, executable will be slow)
\item \texttt{\textbf{-Kieee}} -- Perform floating-point operations in strict conformance with the IEEE 754 standard.
\item \texttt{\textbf{-Ktrap=fp}} -- Controls the behaviour of the processor when exceptions occur. fp traps on floating point exceptions (divide by zeros, invalid operations, floating-point overflows), otherwise they would be masked and the processor would recover from the exception and continue).
\item \texttt{\textbf{-Msave}} -- Assume that all local variables are subject to the Fortran SAVE statement. (Note: this flag can greatly reduce performance, so might consider adding explicit statements only where needed in the source code to achieve speed-up?)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
To use the Intel compilers:
\begin{itemize}
\item Switch out the gnu compilers for the Intel compilers using: \texttt{\$ module switch gnu/native intel/17.0.0}
\item Compile using: \texttt{\$ ifort -O0 -fltconsistency <mainFortranFile>.f -o <mainFortranFile>\_intel.exe}. It appears that the Intel compilers don't have an equivalent flag for Ktrap=fp or Msave (I think Msave behaviour is done by default through the default -auto-scalar flag).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{TERREL}
\subsubsection{Build}
To build the original source code:
\begin{itemize}
\item Download and unzip version 7.0.0 (L141010) from \url{http://www.src.com/calpuff/download/mod7_codes.htm}.
\item Convert all filenames to lowercase using: \texttt{\$ ls | while read upName; do loName=`echo "\${upName}" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'`; mv "\$upName" "\$loName"; done}.
\item In terrel.for, delete the `flen' argument in the line "inquire(file=datafil(k),exist=lexist,flen=isize)". This is a Lahey-specific argument.
\item To get the pgi compilers to work, make the following additional changes:
\begin{itemize}
\item In terrel.for, replace the instance of `\textbackslash' with `/'.
\end{itemize}
\item To get the Intel compilers to work, make the following additional changes:
\begin{itemize}
\item In params.trl, comment out the `Lahey F95 Compiler' block and uncomment the `Compaq DF Compiler' block.
\item In setsrtm() (terrel.for), remove `access=caccess' from the open statement (otherwise TERREL crashes when trying to read in the first line of an SRTM3 data file with a "sequential-access I/O to unit open for direct access" error)
\end{itemize}
\item Compile using preferred compiler, as described above.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Setup}
To set up TERREL:
\begin{itemize}
\item Make a subdirectory called `data' and put the following files inside it:
\begin{itemize}
\item w100n40.dem -- (If using 1km resolution data) The DEM data file for Central America from the GTOPO30 dataset (downloaded via \url{http://www.src.com/calpuff/data/terrain.html}). Make sure to rename this file to the name given here if necessary.
\item n11w086.bil, n12w086.bil, n11w087.bil, n12w087.bil -- (If using 90m resolution data)  The DEM data files the Masaya region from the SRTM 3-sec dataset (downloaded via \url{https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/} -- choose `SRTM Void Filled' and 'BIL' format). Make sure to rename the files to the names given here if necessary.
\item (optional) xy\_masaya.dat -- This is a 2-column text file containing the x and y coordinates (in km, in the same projection as used for the main grid) of receptor points at which the terrain height will be calculated in addition to the gridded points in the main output file (only output if LXY = T in the input file).
\end{itemize}
\item Open the input file (terrel.inp) and make the following changes:
\begin{itemize}
\item NTDF -- Change to `1' if using GTOPO30 data (as we only have one input DEM file) or `4' if using SRTM3 data
\item OUTFIL -- Change to e.g. `masaya.dat'. This is main output file that will contain the gridded processed terrain data.
\item LSTFIL -- Change to e.g. `masaya.lst'. This is essentially the log file.
\item PLTFIL -- Change to e.g. `masaya.grd'. This is an output file that can be plotted with e.g. the Surfer software package.
\item RAWECHO -- Change to e.g. `raw\_masaya.dat'. This is an output file that simply echoes the raw input DEM data but in ASCII format.
\item SAVEFIL -- Change to e.g. `masaya.sav'. This is an output binary save file that can later be used for a continuation run of TERREL (we probably don't need this).
\item XYINP -- (if LXY = T is set below) Change to `data/xy\_masaya.dat'. This is the path to the input receptor points file.
\item XYOUT -- (if LXY = T is set below) Change to e.g. `xyoutput\_masaya.rec'. This is output (elevation heights) at the receptor points.
\item LCFILES -- Set to T (true). This is a bit annoying, but all files have to have names in either full uppercase or lowercase, and I find lowercase nicer.
\item Subgroup (0b) -- At the end of this section, ensure that there are as many lines as input data files. If using GTOPO30 data, there should be one line that reads "1 !GTOPO30 = data/w100n40.dem !     !END!". If using SRTM3 data, there should be 4 lines that read "1 !SRTM3 = data/n11w086.bil !     !END!", "2 !SRTM3 = data/n11w087.bil !     !END!", etc
\item LINTXY -- Set to F (false). Receptor point elevations will not be interpolated but be be the peak heights.
\item XYRADKM -- Set to 5.0. Search radius (km) for locating the peak heights at the receptor points.
\item LCOAST -- Set to F. We don't have coastline data to process.
\item LBLNREAD -- Set to F. We don't have coastline data to process.
\item LVOIDFIL -- Set to F. Don't interpolate to fill void cells. This should ensure the same behaviour as used by Sara.
\item MSHEET -- Set to 0 for now. This will ensure the same coordinate mapping as used by Sara. Consider switching back to 1 at a later date.
\item IUTMZN -- Set to 16. This is the UTM zone for Nicaragua.
\item XREFKM -- Set to 525.09417. This is the x-coordinate of the reference point (lower left corner) of the intended output grid. I think this is an easting (km) relative to the lower left corner of the UTM zone being used.
\item YREFKM -- Set to 1294.23926. This is the corresponding y-coordinate (northing).
\item NX -- For a 1km resolution, set to 91; for a 100m resolution, set to 901. This is the intended number of grid cells in x.
\item NY -- For a 1km resolution, set to 55; for a 100m resolution, set to 541. This is the intended number of grid cells in y.
\item DGRIDKM -- For a 1km resolution, set to 1.0; for a 100m resolution, set to 0.1. This is the intended grid spacing (in x and y) in km.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Run}
To run TERREL, type:\\\\
\tab \texttt{\$ ./terrel\_<compiler>.exe}

\subsection{CTGPROC}
\subsubsection{Build}
To build the original source code:
\begin{itemize}
\item Download and unzip version 7.0.0 (L150211) from \url{http://www.src.com/calpuff/download/mod7_codes.htm}.
\item Convert all filenames to lowercase using: \texttt{\$ ls | while read upName; do loName=`echo "\${upName}" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'`; mv "\$upName" "\$loName"; done}.
\item If using a 100m resolution, increase mxnx and mxny to 901 and 541 respectively in params.ctg
\item To get the pgi compilers to work, make the following changes:
\begin{itemize}
\item In ctgproc.for, replace the instance of `\textbackslash' with `/'.
\end{itemize}
\item To get the Intel compilers to work, make the following changes:
\begin{itemize}
\item In params.ctg, comment out the `Lahey F95 Compiler' block and uncomment the `INTEL Compiler' block.
\item In control.ctg, add the missing variable `lll' to the /CONTROL/ common block.
\end{itemize}
\item Compile using preferred compiler, as described above, but add -mcmodel=medium (or equivalent of if not using ifort) to avoid memory overflow errors.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Setup}
To set up CTGPROC:
\begin{itemize}
\item Make a subdirectory called `data' and put the following file inside it:
nalulcl20.bil -- The `USGS Land Use/Land Cover' BIL format file for North America (Global Lambert Azimuthal), downloaded via \url{http://www.src.com/calpuff/data/land_use.html}. Note that the TIFF-format version of this data file does not work properly (alignment issues).
\item Open the input file (ctgproc.inp) and make the following changes:
\begin{itemize}
\item NDBF -- Set to 1 (we only have one input land-use file).
\item LUDAT -- Set to e.g. lulc1km\_masaya.dat. This is the main output file containing the land-use categories on the intended CALPUFF grid.
\item RUNLST -- Set to e.g. ctgproc\_masaya.lst.
\item Subgroup (0b) -- At the end of this section, ensure that there is only one line that reads "! GLAZNA  =  data/nalulcl20.bil !  !END!". This is the path to the land-use data file.
\item MESHGLAZ -- Set to 2 (1km res) or 11 (100m res). This will e.g. split each 1km input grid cell into 2x2 grid cells (each assigned the same land-use category). This ensures that there will be no 1km-res CALPUFF grid cells with missing data in them.
\item PMAP -- Set to `UTM'
\item IUTMZN -- Set to 16
\item DATUM -- Set to `WGS-84'
\item XREFKM -- Set to 525.09417
\item YREFKM -- Set to 1294.23926
\item NX -- Set to 91 (1km res) or 901 (100m res)
\item NY -- Set to 55 (1km res) or 541 (100m res)
\item DGRIDKM -- Set to 1.0 (1km res) or 0.1 (100m res)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Run}
To run CTGPROC, type:\\\\
\tab \texttt{\$ ./ctgproc\_<compiler>.exe}\\\\
****NOTE**** PGI compiler claims that it can't find the data file, even though it is there. Can therefore only use Intel compilers at present.

\subsection{MAKEGEO}
\subsubsection{Build}
To build the original source code:
\begin{itemize}
\item Download and unzip version 3.2 (L110401) from \url{http://www.src.com/calpuff/download/mod7_codes.htm}.
\item Convert all filenames to lowercase using: \texttt{\$ ls | while read upName; do loName=`echo "\${upName}" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'`; mv "\$upName" "\$loName"; done}.
\item If using a 100m resolution, increase mxnx and mxny to 901 and 541 respectively in params.geo
\item In subroutine `comline' (calutils.for), comment out the call to `getcl' and uncomment the Sun compiler block (this seems to work for both the intel and pgi compilers).
\item Compile using preferred compiler, as described above, but add -mcmodel=medium (or equivalent of if not using ifort) to avoid
\item ***Note*** There are a lot of warning messages with the intel compiler regarding a common block in snow.geo, however, the executable is still generated.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Setup}
To set up MAKEGEO:
\begin{itemize}
\item Make a subdirectory called `data' and put the following file inside it:
\begin{itemize}
\item masaya.dat -- The terrain output file from running TERREL.
\item lulc1km\_masaya.dat -- The land-use output file from running CTGPROC.
\end{itemize}
\item Open the input file (makegeo.inp) and make the following changes:
\begin{itemize}
\item LUDAT -- Set to data/lulc1km\_masaya.dat (or whatever the path to the land-use input data file is).
\item TERRDAT -- Set to data/masaya.dat (or whatever the path to the terrain input data file is).
\item GEODAT -- Set to e.g. geo\_masaya.dat. This is the main output file that will serve as input to CALMET for the geophysical data.
\item RUNLST -- Set to e.g. geo\_masaya.lst
\item LCFILES -- Set to T to keep all filenames lowercase.
\item LSNOW -- Set to F (we don't have any snow data)
\item IUTMZN -- Set to 16
\item XREFKM -- Set to 525.09417
\item YREFKM -- Set to 1294.23926
\item NX -- Set to 91 (1km res) or 901 (100m res)
\item NY -- Set to 55 (1km res) or 541 (100m res)
\item DGRIDKM -- Set to 1.0 (1km res) or 0.1 (100m res)
\item Comment out (i.e. replace all occurrences of `!' with `*') the entries in subgroup 4c and 4e
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Run}
To run MAKEGEO, type:\\\\
\tab \texttt{\$ ./makegeo\_<compiler>.exe}

\subsection{CALETA}
We now use open-source NAM data (the ECMWF data is only free to academic institutions, and so INETER would not be able to acquire this data going forward). However, for completeness, below is information on how to build, setup and run CALETA for using the ECMWF GRIB files
\subsubsection{Build}
To build the original source code:
\begin{itemize}
\item Download version 3.2 (100727) from \url{http://www.src.com/calpuff/download/mod7_codes.htm} and unzip
\item To get the pgi compilers to work, open caleta.f in a text editor, navigate to subroutines `getfile\_fst' and `getfile\_ana' in turn, and replace the `/' with a `\textbackslash' in the 101 format statement.
\item Compile using preferred compiler, as described above.
\end{itemize}
****NOTE, the original caleta.f and the one supplied by IMO are markedly different (see, for example, differences in subroutine lists using \texttt{`\$ fgrep `subroutine' <path/to/orig/caleta.f -i > Orig\_caleta.txt'}, then \texttt{`\$ fgrep `subroutine' <path/to/IMO/caleta.f -i > IMO\_caleta.txt'}, then \texttt{`\$ tkdiff Orig\_caleta.txt IMO\_caleta.txt}.\\\\
To build the IMO version:
\begin{itemize}
\item Copy the files caleta.f, eta2m3d.blk and eta2m3d.cm1 from Mark's Caleta directory, and eta2m3d.par from Mark's RUN directory, into a clean directory and run the appropriate compilation command as above (ifort is preferred).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Setup}
Sara's input file for Caleta (eta2m3d.inp) contains the following 8 lines:
\begin{lstlisting}
M3D file Created from ETA AWIPS 212 Grid for Falconbridge CALMET 
3  ! Flag to indicate ECMWF input data
/path/to/GRIB/files/directory/
/path/to/output/directory/
eta2m3d.lst  ! list file name
10.5,12.5  ! Range Lat
272,275  ! Range Long
1, 25  ! Vertical levels
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Run}
To run the self-built IMO version:
\begin{itemize}
\item From Mark's RUN directory, copy the files grid.dat, timestmp.dat and eta2m3d.inp into the directory. timestmp.dat contains the start date of the simulation in the format ddmmyyyy and is created after running launch\_long\_run.sh. 
\item Run caleta using:\\\\
\tab \texttt{\$ ./caleta\_<compiler>.exe}
\end{itemize}
***NOTE: This gives an output file (out\_caleta.m3d) that is different to the one in Mark's RUN directory. Specifically, the new file has non-zero terrain heights where Mark has all zeros, and also some zeros for sea-level-pressure and bad output (*****) for precipitation. This causes issues in the next step (CALMET). Running the IMO-built version (the "caleta\_masaya" executable in the EXEC directory) on the same input files produces a valid out\_caleta.m3d file; this suggests that the code in Mark's Caleta directory is somehow different to the code used to build the Caleta executable in the EXEC directory.

\subsection{CALMET}
\subsubsection{Build}
To build the original source code:
\begin{itemize}
\item Download version 6.5.0 (150223) from \url{http://www.src.com/calpuff/download/mod7_codes.htm} and unzip. Create a temporary directory, cd into it, and unzip the second file inside. Copy CALMET.INP from this temporary directory into the main unzipped directory, and then delete the temporary directory.
\item Convert all filenames to lowercase using: \texttt{\$ ls | while read upName; do loName=`echo "\${upName}" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'`; mv "\$upName" "\$loName"; done}.
\item If using a 100m resolution, increase mxnx and mxny to 901 and 541 respectively in params.met
\item In params.met, change mxnz from 12 to 27 and mxnzi from 12 to 50.
\item Compile using preferred compiler, as described above.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Setup}
To set up CALMET:
\begin{itemize}
\item Make a subdirectory called `data' and put the following file inside it:
\begin{itemize}
\item geo\_masaya.dat -- The output file from running MAKEGEO.
\item out\_caleta.m3d -- The output file from running CALETA.
\end{itemize}
\item Fix the apparent issue in the out\_caleta.m3d file -- In the first surface data-block, replace the latitudes and longitudes of the first few points in the extraction subdomain to match all the other surface data-blocks.
\item Open the input file (calmet.inp) and make the following changes:
\begin{itemize}
\item GEODAT -- Set to data/geo\_masaya.dat.

\item IPROG -- Set to 14 (i.e. use 3D winds as initial guess field)
\item ISTEPPGS -- Set to 10800 (timestep of the prognostic met model) ***This was set to 3 in Mark's input file, but this caused an error for me, plus 10800 seems correct.***
\item RMAX1-RMAX3 -- Set all to 5.0 (radii of influence in km for stations)
\item RPROG -- Set to 1.0 (weighting parameter of the 3D data).
\item NSMTH -- Set to 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4 ,4 (number of passes in the smoothing procedure for each Z level)

\subsection{CALPUFF}
\subsubsection{Build}
To build the original source code:
\begin{itemize}
\item Download version 7.2.1 (150618) from \url{http://www.src.com/calpuff/download/mod7_codes.htm} and unzip
\item Convert all filenames to lowercase using: \texttt{\$ ls | while read upName; do loName=`echo "\${upName}" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'`; mv "\$upName" "\$loName"; done}.
\item If using a 100m resolution, increase mxnx and mxny to 901 and 541 respectively in params.puf
\item In params.puf, change mxnz from 12 to 27 and mxrec from 10000 to 20000.
\item In calpuff.for, near the end of subroutine `comp' (e.g. just after the call to FOGOUT), insert the following lines of code to write out the hourly concentrations to individual files:\\
\begin{lstlisting}
         do ispec=1,nspec
         write(infile,10000) ispec, nn
10000    format('concrec',I2.2,I4.4,'.dat')

          end do
         end do
         close(50)
\end{lstlisting}
Also add `character*150 infile' to the declarations of this subroutine.
\item Build in two stages. For intel compilers:\\
\tab \texttt{\$ ifort -c modules.for}\\
\tab \texttt{\$ ifort -O0 -fltconsistency calpuff.for modules.o -o calpuff.exe}
\tab (Add the flag -mcmodel=medium if running with 100m resolution)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Setup}
